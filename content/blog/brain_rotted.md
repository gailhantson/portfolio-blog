My brain rotted.

I’ve depended on ChatGPT for the last two or three years. 

Yikes. 

I know I’ve taken a hit to my skills. I’m not even sure I have my own writing voice anymore. 

I’m only half embarrassed, to be frank--I do think I’ve learned a lot from my adventure in “AI”. 

For one, I learned that Pandora’s Box is open and we’re never going back. 

Woops!

Truthfully, I have no idea anymore what I’m truly skilled at, where I’m going next, or if the robots are taking over next year 

or the year after that 

or the year after that…

I do know I’d like to finally set aside one machine for another and start a blog composed of my own human thoughts and sentiments. 

It’s time to return to my original dependency: word processors. 

My trusty LibreOffice Writer instance will save me. 

Ideally, it would also fix my attention span.
