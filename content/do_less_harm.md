title: Do Less Harm in Tech
---

I want to (continue my) work in tech. I want it badly. But I also know it comes with dangers - things that make you pause if you have a conscience.

Still, I want to try. And if I do, I want to do it thoughtfully.

## Accessibility

Accessibility should be a front-runner priority for anyone working in tech. In reality, it often isn't. Designing for everyone makes products better for all of us. Test early, think inclusively, and push for standards. It's not glamorous work, but it's important.

## Responsible Use of AI

I am not anti-AI. These tools are amazing. But we can't let them do the thinking for us.

### Create Worthwhile Works

Don't waste your time spinning your wheels on slop. There's enough of it.

### Think Critically

Now more than ever, critical thinking skills are crucial. AI can hallucinate, mislead, or simplify reality too much. Don't believe everything you read. Learn to find authoritative sources and build from them.

### Protect Your Cognitive Health

Studies suggest overreliance on AI can affect how we think. Be mindful. Step back, reflect, and give your brain real exercise.

## Responsible Use of Resources

Tech isn't free - it consumes energy, materials, and attention. Write efficient code, be aware of environmental costs, and don't overbuild features nobody needs.

## Reducing Tech Waste

Buy hardware that lasts, repair it when you can, and recycle what you can't.

## Ethics and Governance

Respect privacy. Collect only what you need. Include diverse perspectives in design decisions. Be transparent. Take responsibility for the consequences of your work.

## Work-Life Balance

Tech loves hustle culture, but burnout is real. Step away from screens, and protect your mental health. Teams do better when people do better.
