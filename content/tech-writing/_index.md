  **This portfolio is under construction!**
  
  Thank you for stopping by! I decided to publish my portfolio while I'm still working on it. Some sections are still empty or unfinished... In the meantime, if you have questions about a missing piece, reach out!

## Start Over There

When visiting this site from your desktop, the **Doodle Guy** below points to the table of contents on the left, to a link to the page [Start Here](/tech-writing/start_here). (On smaller screens, he's pointing to this paragraph, which includes two links to the page [Start Here](/tech-writing/start_here).)

That's because this portfolio site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the theme [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/), which was designed with documentation in mind. I'm using Markdown, static-site generation, and docs-as-code to show you my portfolio. 

I'm using the `/docs` layout here, which displays the table of contents on the left. Hextra offers other recognizable docs features, too, like the callout below.
