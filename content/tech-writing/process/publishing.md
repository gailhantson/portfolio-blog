### Final Approval

Before publishing, content goes through a final review and approval process. Bring out the stakeholders!

### Docs-as-Code and CI/CD

When using a Docs-as-Code approach, once content gets final approval, it is merged into the main branch and automatically built and published. 

This all happens within the same git, repo management, and pull request tools your developers use.

### Social Network Sharing

Earlier in the writing process, I defined the intended audience. Now, we want to make sure the finished piece actually gets into their hands.

Inside an organization, that might mean collaborating with marketing, support, or community teams. Ideally, we work together to surface the value of fresh docs and make sure they reach the people who can put them to use.
