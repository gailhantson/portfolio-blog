### Pre-writing

### Writing

### Editing

### Publishing

After review and approval, the content gets merged and automatically built using the same tools your devs rely on (i.e. the same tools your boss's boss's boss already paid for). From there, it’s about making sure the right people actually see and use the new docs.
