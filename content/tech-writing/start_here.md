  **This portfolio is under construction!**
  
  Thank you for stopping by! I decided to publish my portfolio while I'm still working on it. Some sections are still empty or unfinished... In the meantime, if you have questions about a missing piece, reach out!

This portfolio showcases my work as a technical writer.

I’ve organized this portfolio to reflect both what I’ve written and how I approach writing. This includes the tools and skills I keep at the ready.
