  **This portfolio is under construction!**
  
  Thank you for stopping by! I decided to publish my portfolio while I'm still working on it. Some sections are still empty or unfinished... In the meantime, if you have questions about a missing piece, reach out!

Here’s where I’m solid, and where I build a little every day to get better at what I do. These skills write clear docs and keep my systems running.

## Systems

- Linux systems (especially Debian-based distros)
- Filesystems, permissions, users, processes
- Command-line tools and basic shell scripting
- Networking basics: IP, ports, DNS, NAT, SSH
- Homelab setups and self-hosted tools
- Hardware basics and system installs

## Documentation

- Technical writing for IT and infrastructure topics
- Docs-as-Code workflows (Markdown, Git, static site generators)
- Tools like Docusaurus, MkDocs, Hugo
- Clean, structured procedural writing
- Personal knowledge systems (Markdown + Git)
- Collaboration with engineers, support, and other teams
